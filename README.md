`raylib-ffi` aims to provide a "no frills" direct binding to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for rust developers.

This library is largely auto-generated by the code in `build/`. Raylib itself exposes lots of metadata, meaning that wrappers can auto-translate the C API into whatever language is needed (in this case, Rust).

## Dependencies

Fedora:

```sh
dnf install clang-devel alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel libatomic cmake
```

## Verifying your build

`raylib-ffi` bundles a rust version of the example project from raylib proper. To verify your build of this library worked, run:

```sh
cargo run --example basic
```

## Versioning policy

`raylib-ffi` follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

The major and minor version numbers of a `raylib-ffi` will always match the version of raylib it was built against. The patch version may be incremented if a rust-only fix is needed at any point.
